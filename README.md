# 5e_NPC_Generator
 Simple D&D 5e NPC Generator based info from official DM Screen

This was created in python and built into an executable in 2017.
To run, download the repo, extract it, and run the executable file at "5e NPC Generator\NPC_Generator.exe"
It will run a simple program in a terminal window which will prompt you for a number of NPCs to generate.
They will be generated and displayed in the terminal and saved in a text file at "5e NPC Generator\NPCs.txt".
If run again, the text file will be overwritten, so save it elsewhere if you need.
